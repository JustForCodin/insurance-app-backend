# Insurance app

This is my implementation of back-end part of the assignment, given to me during
first month of internship at TechMagic Academy. This app is an 
example of contracts management automation in some insurance company.
I developed this project using Angular 19, Express.js and Mongoose/MongoDB.
I added some data from my local DB for easier database setup to run the project locally.

# How to run

1. install the dependencies

```
cd insurance-app-backend
npm install
```

2. start the server with

```
npm run dev
# or
npm run start
```
